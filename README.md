With an increasing usage of high-resolution screens, we’ve seen the rise of SVG icons. Unlike a bitmap graphic, SVG is scalable and resolution independent that allows it to remain sharp regardless of the size and the screen resolution.

So here we’ve put together the best resources from where you can get high-quality SVG icons. Some of the resources provide more than just the icons with convenient features to boost the productivity of designers and developers.

## Without further ado, let’s jump in the full list.
